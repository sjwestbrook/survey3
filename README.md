# survey3

CSS experimentation - transitions, etc


Take the most recent working back end (minus Ryan's current front end) and make my front end. Make it match up to the endpoints below. Focus on LESS and Webpack. Make responsive if time allows. Make an edit page if time allows (e.g. remove a student form a cohort if time allows.).

ADMIN SECTION Make a survey with swappable parts.

TEMPLATES -- first page Name, Topic, Subject - whatever was taught that day, Recipient Group, Date, Questions,

TOPIC - can add a list of topics -- second page. "how did Jarod do?" Jarod must be replaceable - use an escape sequence eg $$instructor_name$$ Jarod, Michael, Jeremy,

SUBJECT - what was taught that day

DATE

RECIPIENT GROUP - can add a list of groups -- 3rd page EX. DM6 -Sarah (and email address) -Ryan (and email address) -all other cohort members

Now go into a screen with a dropdown -- 4th page -pick a template (instructor, mentor, self-assessment, group-assessment) -pick the topic (eg Jarod if it's an instructor survey) -pick a cohort -click send

**** AFTER SURVEYS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BY STUDENTS ****

"OTHER ADMIN VIEW" -select topic and session -view survey results - questions down the size with answers filling in horizontally -view a list of topics to pick from -provides list of surveys -click on survey to view individual results

USER SECTION / STUDENT VIEW

-log in and see which surveys i'm being asked to take -- 1ST PAGE

only shows surveys not yet taken - currently must refresh screen to view updates
-click on a survey --> 2ND PAGE -expand to show question, or go to new page with question and answer options, and "DONE" -results go back to admin section, where Jeremy can view the results ("other admin view")
